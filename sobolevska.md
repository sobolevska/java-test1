### Practical

1. Very good!
2. Good! Minor thing: you do not need to create a new scanner every time you want to read something. You can use the existing scanner.

### Tips:
Work on cleaning up your formatting and indentation. Remember to give your variables meaningful names.
All of that will help you orientate yourself in your own code easier, expand on it, understand it's structure and eventually proceed with solving more difficult problems.
